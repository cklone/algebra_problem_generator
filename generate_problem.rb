# Start with the answer
# x = 4

# Now, come up with a simple addition/subtraction algebra problem
# x + y = z where x = 4
# x = z - y so what could z and y be to make x 4?
# 12 - 8 = 4, so z = 12 and y = 8, plug it in to the equation, and the problem is:
# x + 8 = 12

puts "Problem: x + 8 = 12"
puts "Answer:  x = 4"
